3. **Feature Importance**: Simplified for most algorithms
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses fixed hyperparameters (no auto-tuning)
5. **Model Persistence**: Models not saved (train each time)

### Future Enhancements (Set B):
- Advanced ML mode with 22+ algorithms
- Python backend for heavy computation
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model saving/loading
- Ensemble methods
- Deep learning models

1. ✅ Complete manual testing (use TESTING_QUICK_ML.md)
2. 🐛 Fix any bugs found during testing
3. 📝 Update main README with ML features
4. 🎨 Polish UI/UX based on testing feedback

### Future (Set B - Advanced ML):
1. Set up Python backend (Flask/FastAPI)
2. Implement 22+ algorithms using scikit-learn
3. Add hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch/RandomSearch)
4. Implement ensemble methods (Stacking, Voting)
5. Add deep learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
6. Model persistence and versioning

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Best Results:
- Use datasets with 100-5000 rows
- Ensure target column is numeric (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Remove non-numeric columns before ML
- Enable feature engineering for better performance
- Use Quick ML for fast iteration
- Compare multiple algorithms to find best

### Troubleshooting:
- **No ML section?** → Ensure data is loaded and cleaned
- **Training fails?** → Check target column exists and is numeric
- **Poor performance?** → Try feature engineering or different dataset
- **Slow training?** → Reduce dataset size or use fewer features
